# Sign language recognition

Working on the [Google - Isolated Sign Language Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asl-signs) Kaggle competition.

Started this because some of my students were working on this project, and I wanted to try out some functions to find simpler ways.

## Main practices covered so far:
- Working with pyarrow to load parquet files
- Using TensorFlow Datasets
- Practice writing tests
